# SDN Traffic Management and Analysis Tool

This project aims to develop a Python-based application for analyzing and managing traffic in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments using the OpenFlow protocol. The tool will provide functionalities for monitoring network traffic, optimizing resource allocation, and implementing custom traffic control policies. It is designed to enhance network performance, scalability, and flexibility in modern SDN infrastructures.

## Key Features
- **Traffic Analysis**: Real-time monitoring and visualization of network traffic.
- **Traffic Management**: Dynamic traffic routing and load balancing using OpenFlow.
- **Custom Policies**: Support for user-defined traffic control rules.
- **Scalability**: Efficient handling of large-scale SDN networks.
- **Extensibility**: Modular design for easy integration with other SDN tools.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Protocol**: OpenFlow
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: To be determined during development.

Stay tuned for updates as the project progresses!
